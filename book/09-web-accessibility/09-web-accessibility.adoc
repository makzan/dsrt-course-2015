We build the web for every one. That's why accessibility is an important topic.

== Making the web inclusive

One difference between web and app is that web pages should be designed to be inclusive. It doesn't and never lock into particular platform. It's designed so that every one can get the information. This is why we need to handle accessibility in our web pages.


== Font Size and Basic


- Use percentage unit instead of fixed unit
- Use `alt` and write real meaning. An empty `alt` usually means decorative image that's is not part of the content.
- Use `title` in <img> tag for mouse hover tooltip
- Enable Viewport scaling

== Form Accessibility

In input, use <label> `for`.

== Contrast

Your background and front color should have a clear contrast.

Check your contrast raito with this tool from Lea Verou.

TIPS: You can focus the cursor on a numeric value and presss `up` and `down` key to adjust the value. This allows you to fine tune the value easily.
