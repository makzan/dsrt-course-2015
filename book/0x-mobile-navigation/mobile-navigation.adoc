The strategy to make mobile navigation works.

== Navigation difference between platform
The difference is huge
Windows, Android, iOS
It's not about the style (Skeuomorphism or "flat", or depth)
It's about the user habits.
It's about the strategy (tabs on bottom, tabs at top, infinite canvas)
It's about the hardware buttons that affects the software design

== Hamburger menu?
Conclusion: avoid it.
At least don't just put the hamburger menu there.

== Case study navigationâ€”Facebook
First 9 grid
Then list view
Then hamburger menu
Then double hamburger menu
Then removed main hamburger menu and back to tab
