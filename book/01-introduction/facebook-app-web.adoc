== Case study―Facebook app

At the beginning, Facebook app uses a 9-grid navigation which was a native Objective-C app.

Then it changes to a modern table view layout, still as native app.

Then, Facebook changes the entire app into HTML5 to support one codebase with multiple platforms.

The team didn’t satisfy with the performance and they used months to rebuild the app into native app again. The same outlook, but everything are coded in Xcode.
