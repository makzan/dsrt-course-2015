== Server side pre-rendering React component

Why we need to pre render the React component?

That's fallback for browsers that don't have JavaScript support.

The exact technique depends on what server-side technology you use. For example, in Rails, ReactJS team made a gem named `rails-react` which render the React component in Rails way. It provides a feature to compile the React component in server by using the node.js runtime.
