We can make our web app offline to use.

== Making web app offline

There are two levels of caching things offline.

1. Storing the user data
2. Caching the files, including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript

The first one still needs Internet access to fetch the app files, which is the HTML, JavaScript logic and the CSS styles. The second one, cache these files as well to archive truly offline usage. You can even power on the iPhone in airplane mode and the web app still works without Internet.

== Offline example


1. Go to the PieGuy web page in mobile Safari.
2. Add the PieGuy to home screen.
3. Open the PieGuy game once, with Internet access.
4. Take the phone offline by turning on airplane mode. You may even turn off the iPhone and turn it on again.
5. Launch the PieGuy game from home screens and the game should work without issues.
